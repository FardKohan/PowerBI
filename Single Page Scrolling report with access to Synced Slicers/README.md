Here I have created a simple example/workaround as a demo to show how to access slicer's panel across a vertical scrolling page and especially at the bottom of the page in each section if we had a long vertical scrolling report page. Actually I've used the same simple bookmarking technique plus synced slicers on a single page. 

Based on the idea of ​​Line Arnbjørn Krogh and Julian Barker who were looking for a solution to create a "sticky header" in Power BI to create a scrollable page where filters stay on top. At the time this idea was proposed, there was no native solution in Power BI except the embedded report, which is a completely separate issue.
