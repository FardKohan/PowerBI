Here I have created a simple example/workaround as a demo to show how to access slicer panel across a vertical single page scrolling report in Power BI and especially at the bottom of the page in each section if we had a long vertical scrolling report page. Actually I've used the same simple bookmarking technique plus synced slicers on a single page. 

> ðŸ”„ **When multiple slicers from the same field need to sync, simply checking them in the Sync slicers pane isnâ€™t enough. You also need to assign them the same group name in Advanced options.**

It was for collaboration when I came across Line ArnbjÃ¸rn Krogh and Julian Barker's post on LinkedIn, who were looking for a solution to create a "sticky header" in Power BI to create a scrollable page where filters stay on top. A great idea, but unfortunately at the time of this idea, there was no native solution in Power BI except for embedded report, which is a completely separate issue.
